## Motivation

This project was created to explore a variety of technologies and patterns I use daily in one place to get a better understanding of those technologies.

Things I would like to explore:

- Functional Programming
- Automated Tests
- Basics of Angular, TypeScript, Rxjs, and Bootstrap
- Synergy that exists between Azure Functions and .Net Core Web Apis
  - Implementations of comparable endpoints in both projects to evaluate the tooling and ecosystems
- Having fun!

## Roadmap

- MVP

  - Initial Employee CRUD functionality
  - Initial Payroll CRUD functionality
  - Basic charting and analytics of payroll data

- TODOs

  - Move seed data to CosmosDB document instead of boilerplate c# code
  - Refactor client to use Akita state management
  - Toggle between Api and Azure Function backends
  - Advanced analytics like payroll totals by department, risk, and time

## Feedback and Contributing

Feel free to open PRs with additional examples, tests, or refactorings.
